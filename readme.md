# Neural network from scratch
## This is digit(0-9) recognition neural network that predicts what is writen on 28*28 pixel image (total 784 pixels).
## Have total two one-input and one-output layer.
## Inpul layer consity of 748 neurons.
## Outpul layer have 10 neurons (each responsible for prediction of individual digit 0-9).
## Libraries used pandas , numpy and matplotlib
## Input data source- kaggel.
